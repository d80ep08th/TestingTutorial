> If you are to build a developer community from scratch what would be the step by step approach you would want to follow  ?
#### Answer :

1. Team : Get like minded folks with the right kind of experience aboard. 

2. Flat Hierarchy : Itâ€™s not a company so ensure a flat hierarchy .

3. Vision :  Have a clearly defined vision. Without a direction a community is condemned to meander meaninglessly .

4. Onboarding : Have some onboarding plan to add new members to the community that makes them feel welcome.
5. Meetings : 
- Have weekly online meeting ( or monthly or bi-weekly) for an hour where the community members can come together from anywhere in the world with the issues and the new developments, and have technical discussions. 
- A page that displays the schedule of meetings and detailed information of old meetings that include: the minutes of the meetings as well as the members that were present during that particular meeting.  

5. Consistent Performance Tracking: Observe and analyze the performance of the community regularly with stakeholders

6. Documentation : A webpage/message board/discourse/forum etc that forms a base of knowledge that newer community members can refer to.

8. Conferences : Attend conferences where other communities are present to infuse new ideas.

9. Hosting Meetups:  Host an event that brings the community together and get  the active community members involved in the management of the meetups. They should feel like they have a stake in the well-being of the community.
